     <h2>Description</h2>
       <p>Don't let the strong taste of fennel scare you: it fades down after cooking.</p>
       <p>This is a rich and creamy risotto, just like it ought to be! You can use chicken stock in place of the vegetable stock, as well as olive oil for the butter.</p>
     <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
       <li>4 bulbs fennel</li>
       <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
       <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
       <li>2 cups uncooked Arborio rice</li>
       <li>7 cups vegetable broth</li>
       <li>6 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
       <li>1 tablespoon dried parsley</li>
       <li>freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>      
      </ul>
     <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
       <li>Cut the base off of the fennel bulbs, and cut a cone shape into the base to remove the core. Slice the fennel vertically (lengthwise) into 1/4 inch thick slices.</li>
       <li>Melt butter in a heavy-bottomed stock pot over medium heat. Cook onions and fennel in butter for 2 minutes. Stir in the rice; cook for another 2 minutes, stirring constantly, until lightly toasted. Stir in 1 cup vegetable broth; continue stirring until liquid is almost completely absorbed. Repeat this process with remaining broth, stirring constantly. Incorporating the broth should take 15 to 20 minutes in all.</li> 
       <li>Stir in cream, 3 tablespoons Parmesan and parsley, and cook until rice is done and risotto is thick and creamy. Season to taste with black pepper. Divide risotto among 6 bowls, and sprinkle with remaining cheese.</li> 
      </ol>
